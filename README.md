# Cluster_sampling
Project Description

This project is an interactive R Shiny application that demonstrates cluster sampling design for estimating a population mean. The app computes the required number of clusters based on allowable error, bias, and confidence level, and summarizes the cost and time implications of the sampling plan. A visual representation highlights selected and non-selected clusters, making the tool useful for learning and teaching cluster sampling concepts in statistics and data science.
